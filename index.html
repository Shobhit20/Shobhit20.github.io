              <p>I am a Data Scientist with a strong foundation in Mathematics and four years of work experience in Data Science
                in the insurance-tech (Roadzen) and food-tech (Spoonshot) sector. During both these stints, I have handled multiple
                problem statements in the domain of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. I am adept in Python and highly
                skilled with advanced Machine Learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and LangChain. I have successfully 
                developed and deployed high-impact solutions in production environments. Currently, I am finishing off my M.Sc. in 
                Data Science from the University of Edinburgh with my dissertation work focussing on QA frameworks using Large 
                Language Models (LLMs). I'm excited by the rapid advancements in AI and how they enable solving real-world challenges.

              <p>
                I am a huge sports fan, especially when it comes to Cricket and Football. I am a big Real Madrid supporter (hala madrid
                 y nada mas!!). I have played Table Tennis at the state levels. Outside of sports, I am all about good food—whether I am 
                 cooking up something tasty or just enjoying a great meal. Music is always a part of my day too; I am constantly up for 
                 some Coke Studio jams or chilling to retro tunes. I am also a big animal lover, especially when it comes to dogs—Border 
                 Collies are my absolute favorite. Being around dogs always puts me in a good mood. I've recently discovered that Alpacas 
                 are literally nothing but just big dogs who run really fast so that is me holding Ozzy and Thomas on the right. It is 
                 those simple things—food, music, sports, and dogs/animals that make me happy.

                Analyzing financial reports, which often span hundreds of pages, is a time-consuming process. Large Language Models 
                (LLMs) have improved the efficiency of Question Answering (QA) in such reports, but their context-length limitations pose 
                challenges, especially when dealing with long documents. Additionally, LLMs struggle to retrieve information from the middle 
                sections of really long context promopts. The MapReduce framework addresses this by dividing the PDF into smaller chunks, allowing efficient 
                processing in two phases. We enhanced this method with rank filtering to optimize LangChain MapReduce, and compared it to a 
                Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, our baseline for QA on the FinanceBench dataset. Unlike RAG, which relies on a 
                retriever module that impacts performance, MapReduce bypasses this, resulting in a 16% efficiency gain. We incorporated this 
                method into a GUI-based QA tool for PDF reports. Additionally, we created a dataset by scraping financial reports from all London 
                Stock Exchange (LSE) companies, providing a valuable resource for future research. Our framework enables financial experts to 
                analyze lengthy PDF documents more efficiently.

            <h3>Neural Machine Translation (NMT)</h3>
            <p>

              <span class="project-description">
                This project revolved around building a Neural Machine Translation model from scratch along with a conventional LSTM model with lexical decoding.

                The experiments started with implementing
                an LSTM model with attention. Based on the drawbacks of the previous model, we incorporate a lexical decoding module which 
                The lexical model addresses this issue using a small feed-forward neural network(FFNN). The network takes a weighted average
                of the source embeddings with respect to attention weights i.e. The output of the FFNN is combined with the decoder output. 
                The lexical model outperforms the baseline model comfortably in all evaluation metrics. In order to improve the metrics further 
                a Transformer model with Multi-headed attention module is implemented from scratch. The entire training is done using only 10k 
                sentences for German to English Translation. Transformers are usually data hungry and thus lexical model performs better than 
                the Transformer architecture but the training and loss curves indicate the ability that the Transformer architecture possess if 
                given large data to train on. The model reached a BLEU score of 13.5 on just 10k sentences and the attention plots show the capability
                of attention mechanism.

            <p>
              <span class="project-description">
                This project investigates the performance of classical machine learning and deep learning models in 
                classifying images of sports balls, from 15 different categories.

                The dataset comprises over 9,000 images, 
                testing the models ability to distinguish similar objects under varying conditions. The classical approach combines 
                Scale-Invariant Feature Transform and Histogram of Oriented Gradients features to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
                models, while the deep learning approach utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the ResNet-18 architecture.
                The study tries to contrast the models performance using metrics such as accuracy, and F1 scores, and confusion matrices. 
                We also analyze the robustness of our models by inducing image perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusion. 
                While the classical approach provides insights into feature importance, the CNN model significantly outperforms the 
                SVM in terms of accuracy and robustness. This research contributes to the broader understanding of image classification techniques, 
                highlighting the advantages of deep learning models in handling complex, real-world data scenarios.

                Medical imaging as a field has gained significant traction in recent times due to its applications, 
                but one of the biggest problems that remain in these images is the aberrations that appear due to apparatus 
                limitations or other environmental factors. X-rays are also not immune to such imperfections, but getting rid 
                of this noise can result in efficient diagnostics, aiding the enhancement of image quality and accuracy in medical 
                assessments. Previous attempts at generating noisy datasets for X-rays make an assumption of a uniform scatter of noise 
                on the image. We induce an uneven scatter of noise in images, more towards the center of the X-ray, where the interaction 
                of X-rays with tissues is greater. We train multiple incremental updates to our model on the NIH X-ray dataset after inducing noise using the core 
                concepts of encoder-decoder architecture. We also propose an end-to-end pipeline stacking the two best-performing 
                models. Despite training on a subset of only 10k images, the resultant de-noised images seem to be promising. The 
                objective evaluation of the model is carried out using the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), 
                and the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR).
